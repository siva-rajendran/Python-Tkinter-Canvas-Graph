##Python tkinter canvas widget
By using Canvas we can add the graphical shapes like line, circle, arc and much more.

See full reference from [anzeljg.github.io (tkinter-canvas)](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/canvas.html "anzeljg.github.io")

##Reference
Created this program to experiment(learn) about the canvas widget of python tkinter GUI library.

To create this, I have used [mathsisfun.com (Amplitude, Period, Phase Shift and Frequency Graph)](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/amplitude-period-frequency-phase-shift.html "Maths-is-fun.com (Amplitude, Period Graph)") website for reference.

##Realtime Use
This program doesn't have any practical application is just a scrap. If you want to experiment about tkinter canvas or need to know how to create simple graph in canvas you can fork this and use.
